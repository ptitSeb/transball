Transball GL is a sequel to 'Super Transball 2', a thrust-like game. You can find the original 'Super Transball 2' visiting http://www.braingames.getput.com/stransball2

The current version has only been tested in Mac OS X and Windows XP, but due to the use of cross-platform libraries it should compile properly also in Linux.
